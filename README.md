# lst_data_analysis

This repository contains two kind of Python scripts to develop two task:

* _Read the information sent by the timing system_ to the camera server of the telescope to construct absolute TimeStamps and analyze them. This code is based on the one developed by M.Punch (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in the Astroparticule et Cosmologie (APC) laboratory)

* _Show and use the LST1 analysis chain_: Make the different calibrations and corrections to the raw data form the LST1 telescope of the CTA observatory. All the code is based on scripts and notebooks developed by the CTA collaboration. This codes are based on programs and notebooks developed by the LST collaboration.
